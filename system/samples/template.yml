PROPOSITION:
# <PROP_ID> : <TEXT>

ASSUMPTION: [ ]
# [<PROP_ID> ]

ARGUMENT:
# a sequence of map (dictionary) mapping the argument id to its fields - premise, exception, conclusion weight
# premise and exception are list while conclusion is a single propositions
# the weights are double, ranging from 0 to 1
# `-` infront of the PROP_ID will denote the negation of the proposition
#
#  <ARG_ID> : # indent level = 1
#    premise :  [ <PROP_ID> ] # each field is at indent level = 2
#    exception : [ <PROP_ID> ]
#    conclusion: <PROP_ID>
#    weight : <Double between 0 and 1>

PROOFSTANDARD :
# [] # use default proof standard - scintilla for all; OR
# Acceptable PS are :
# scintilla,
# preponderance,
# clear and convincing,
# beyond reasonable doubt,
# dialectical validity
#
#   <PROP_ID> : <PS> OR

ACCEPTABILITY: [ ]
# [<PROP_ID>]

PARAMETER:
# each parameter is in the range of 0 and 1
# alpha: <Double between 0 and 1>
# beta: <Double between 0 and 1>
# gamma: <Double between 0 and 1>
