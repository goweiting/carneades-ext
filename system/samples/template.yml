PROPOSITION:
# a sequence of map (dictionary) mapping the key to the `text` field
  first: first in the line
  second: second in the line
  third: thrid in the line

ASSUMPTION: [first] # a list of assumptions

ARGUMENT:
# a sequence of map (dictionary) mapping the argument id to its fields - premise, exception, conclusion weight
# premise and exception are list while conclusion is a single propositions
# the weights are double, ranging from 0 to 1
# available standards are: `scintilla`, `preponderance`, `clear and convincing`, `beyond reasonable doubt`, and `dialectical validity`
  not first means third unless is second:
    premise: [-first] # - infront will denote the negation of the proposition above, if it exists
    exception: [second] # unless the exception is true, the argument is valid
    conclusion: third # is not a list!
    weight: 0.01

  not second means third unless is first:
    premise: [-second]
    exception: [first]
    conclusion: third
    weight: 0.2

  not third means second unless not first:
    premise: []
    exception: [-first]
    conclusion: second
    weight : 0.9

PROOFSTANDARD : [] # use scintilla for all

ACCEPTABILITY: [third, -third] # ACCEPTABILITY calls the acceptability function in caes to check if the conlusion is acceptable.

PARAMETER:
# define the parameters use for the proofstandard
# each parameter is in the range of 0 and 1
  alpha: 0.3
  beta: 0.2
  gamma: 0.3
