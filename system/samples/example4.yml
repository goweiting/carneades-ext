# Toy example to illistrate:
# If there are two arguments supporting the same issue, as long as it is not
# attacked such that the burden of proof is shifted, then there is no need
# to choose another argument. The argument evaluation can then be automatically
# terminated
# Also, we always choose the highest weighted argument to start with
