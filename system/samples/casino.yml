# Parlimentary debate for building of Integrate Resort (Casino)
#
# Summary:
# The main debate is on the weight of building an IR so as to stimulate the economy
# or to prevent additional social harm from the building of IR
# During the debate for economic benefits, the impending recession and increase competitiveness in the tourism sector (which accounts for a large part of the GDP) is main focus
# The arguments for damage to the society was deemed iffy due to the
# already available gambling options in nearby countries, and ease of gambling from remote gambling.
# Also, it is largely believed that the additional measures for locals will be
# effective to reduce the additional ill-effects from gambling, if any.
# 
# However, now, on hindsight that the social discontent (largely due to huge
# increase in population and constraint in infrastructure) from
# hiring of foreign labours for the IRs, it is obvious that the social harm
# will outweight the economic benefit.
# This is modelled in the argument "Support will be provided for to prevent
# additional social harm due to IR" where if "foreign workers impact" is
# considered in the exception, then the decision to "build" the IRs will be unacceptable
#
# Nevertheless, this is an effect that was unforseeable during the parlimentary debate (hence not taken into consideration).
