PROPOSITION:
  # Cases and principles referred to
  s52 : Section 52(1) of Trade Practice Act - "A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive."





  consumers are misled: "the 'ordinary' or 'reasonable' members of that class" are misled or deceived
  # confusion: conduct causing confusion and wonderment is not necessarily co-extensive with misleading or deceptive conduct

  # about the user:
  internet user: An internet user who wishes to access a webpage is likely to use an internet search engine, such as Google
  understanding search: It is not possible for Internet users to use a search engine without any meaningful way without knowing something about how it operates.

  # about google
  organic results: Organic search results are links to webpages ranked in order of relevance to the search terms entered by the user, and order of appearance of resuts is determined by its algorithm
  sponsored links: Sponsored links only appear when the user's searcg term matches one of the advertiser's
  display separately: Organic results and sponsored links are labelled and displayed separately
  distinguishable: Sponsored links are displayed separately from organic results hence distinguishable
  adwords: Advertises uses AdWords to create and purchase advertisements. Sponsored link is created by, or at the direction of, an advertiser who typically pats Google each time a user of the Google search engine clicks on the sponsored links.
  # AdWords program, not the organic search algorithm, determines if 1) sponsored links are displayed, 2) the order and position of sponsored links


  trigger sponsored links: Google outputs the sponsored links that are triggered by search terms corresponding to the keywords chosen by advertiser
  control over user's search term: Google controls search terms entered by users of its search engine, or material available on the web
  control over advert keywords: Google controls advertiser's choice of keywords
  control over advertisers: Google have control over the production of sponsored links given a user's search request


  # Past cases considered
  Yorke: In Yorke vs Lucas - It does not mean that a corporation which purports to do no more than pass on information supplied by another must nevertheless be engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct if the information turns out to be false.
  Guthrie: In Universal Telecasters (Qld) Ltd v Guthrie - It is difficult to distinguish the case where,..., a statement - express words of adoption or exclusion, was made for or on behalf of another
  Gardam: In Gardam v George Wills & Co Ltd - A carrier is considered as a conduit and does not have representation; unless relevant section of the public regards the carrier as adopting it.
  Butcher: In Butcher - The agent in question should be analyse according to the nature of the parties (the vendor and the agent), the character of the transaction and the content of the advertisement

  misleading : Google has engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by publishing or displaying the sponsored links
  adoption and representation: Google adopts and endorse the advertisements created by advertisers


  # Evidence and arguments by ACCC
  intermediaries: Google and Google search engine do not operate analogously to other intermediaries or agents # (such as newspaper and broadcasters)
  misleading advertisements: It has been proven that the sponsored links conveyed misleading and deceptive representations  # concluded in the Full Court of the Federel Court, and the High Court agrees
  publishing is representation : By publishing sponsored links that are misleading, Google represents the advertisers

  publisher status: Google is a corporation that publishes, communicates or passes on the misleading representation of another party.
