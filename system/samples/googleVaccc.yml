  # Cases and principles referred to
  s52 : Section 52(1) of Trade Practice Act 1974 - "A corporation shall not, in trade or commerce, engage in conduct that is misleading or deceptive or is likely to mislead or deceive."
  s85 : Section 85(3) of Trade Practice Act 1974 - "... it is a defence if the defendant establishes that he or she is a person whose business it is to publish or arrange for the production of advertisements and that he or she received the advertisement for publication in the ordinary course of business and did not kow and had no reason to susoect that its publication would amount to a contravention of a provision of that Part"
  demonstration: not necessaryt to demonstrate actual deception to establish a contravention of s52
  consumers: the court must consider whether "the 'ordinary' or 'reasonable' members of that class" would be misled or deceived
  confusion: conduct causing confusion and wonderment is not necessarily co-extensive with misleading or deceptive conduct

  # about the user:
  internet user: An internet user who wishes to access a webpage is likely to use an internet search engine, such as Google
  control over user: Google does not control search terms entered by users of its search engine, or material available on the web

  # about google
  organic results: Organic search results are links to webpages ranked in order of relevance to the search terms entered by the user, and order of appearance of resuts is determined by its algorithm
  sponsored links: Sponsored links are ...?
  display separately: Sponsored links are displayed separately from organic results
  adwords: AdWords program, not the organic search algorithm, determines if 1) sponsored links are displayed, 2) the order and position of sponsored links
  participation in adwords: participation in AdWords is subhect to Google's Terms of Service, the AdWords Program Terms, and applicable Google policies

  # Past cases considered
  Yorke: In Yorke vs Lucas - It does not mean that a corporation which purports to do no more than pass on information supplied by another must nevertheless be engaging in misleading or deceptive conduct if the information turns out to be false.
  Guthrie: In Universal Telecasters (Qld) Ltd v Guthrie - It is difficult to distinguish the case where,..., a statement - express words of adoption or exclusion, was made for or on behalf of another
  Gardam: In Gardam v George Wills & Co Ltd - A carrier is considered as a conduit and does not have representation; unless relevant section of the public regards the carrier as adopting it.
  Butcher: In Butcher - The agent in question had done no more than communicate the vendor's representation to purchaers without adopting or endorsing it. The conclusion should be reached by analysing the nature of the parties (the vendor and the agent), the character of the transaction and the content of the brochure
  users interpretation: A corporation which publishes, communicates or passes on the misleading representation have engaged in misleading or deceptive conduct depends on interpretation of ordinary and reasonable users of the relevant class


  misleading : Google has engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct by publishing or displaying the sponsored links
  adoption and representation: Google adopts and endorse the advertisements created by advertisers
