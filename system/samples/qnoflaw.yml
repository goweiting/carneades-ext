# for 'If the Government is entitled to prerogrative powers and without reference to the parliment'. This is a question of law and procedure, rather than the case of brexit

PROPOSITION :
  invoke: Government can invoke Article 50 with Crown prerogative powers # i.e. ministerial power exercised without parlimentary authority
  TEU is international treaty: TEU is an International Treaty
  TEU affects domestic law: TEU have effect on UK domestic law
  making and unmaking: Making and unmaking a treaty requires the same procedures
  fundamental constitutional law: Crown is sovereign and legislation enacted by the Crown with the consent of both Houses of Parliment is supreme
  parliment power: Parliment must pass the necessary legislation if there are changes to domestic law
  bill of rights 1688: Bill of Rights 1688 - making and unmaking of treaties is a Crown prerogative act because a treaty cannot alter domestic law; prerogative powers can only be exercised on the international plane
  ECA1972: The Parliment had enacted European Communities Act 1972 for the accession of the UK to the European Communities
  s2(1): ECA1972 Section 2(1) applies EU Law - rights, powers, liabilities, obligations and restrictions to the UK
  art 50: Article 50 of the Treaty of European Union will initiate an irreversible process of leaving the EU

ASSUMPTION : [ECA1972, s2(1), art 50, making and unmaking, parliment power, fundamental constitutional law, bill of rights 1688, TEU is international treaty ]

  the ECA and s2(1) have effect on domestic law, unless it is removed (such as using art 50):
    premise: [ECA1972, s2(1), TEU is international treaty]
    exception: [art 50]
    conclusion: TEU affects domestic law

  because TEU affects domesitc law, hence parliment is required to approve it:
    premise: [TEU affects domestic law]
    exception: []

  because parliment approves it, it is supreme:
    premise: [parliment power, fundamental constitutional law]
    exception: []
    conclusion: -invoke
