# An example from the Gorden et al (2007) paper, borrowing an example from Prakken and Sartor about a murder trial
# Using the Scheme for arguments from legal rules:
#   - The validity of a legal rule is assumed and supported with evidence only if questioned
#   - being excluded by some other (legal) rule is an exception
PROPOSITION:
  murder: the defendant murdered the victim
  malice : evidence for malice (intent of murder)
  killing: evidence for killing
  s187 valid: Section 187 - murder is unlawful killing, is valid
  s187 excluded: s187 is excluded
  self-defense: an act of self-defense
  s197 valid: Section 197 - An act of self-defense, is valid
  s197 excluded: s197 is excluded
  w1: Witness1 testified 'attack'
  w1-credible: Witness1 is credible
  w1-liar: Witness1 lied in court (contempt of court)
  w2: Witness2 saw testified 'time to run away'
  w2-credible: Witness2 is credible

ASSUMPTION: [] # legal rules are assumed to be valid, unless questioned

ARGUMENT:
  arg1 :
    premise: [killing, malice] # these ordinary premises are assumed to be supported
    exception: [s187 excluded]
    conclusion: murder
    weight: 0.5

# The prosecution has met its burden of production
# Next, the defense put forward its self-defense argument:
  arg2:
    premise: [self-defense]
    exception: [s197 excluded]
    conclusion: s187 excluded # !!! this will cause the s187-valid to be removed from the audience's assumption
    weight: .5

  arg3 : # simplified scheme for arguments from testimony
# Since the testimony is made in court, the argument is accepted in court.
    premise: [w1]
    exception: [-w1-credible] # unless w1 is not credible
    conclusion: self-defense
    weight: 0.5

# The prosecution called a second witness to testify that the defendant had enough time to run away
  arg4:
    premise: [w2]
    exception: [-w2-credible]
    conclusion: -self-defense
    weight: 0.5

    exception: []
    conclusion: -w1-credible
    weight: 0.9
