# An example from the Gorden et al (2007) paper, borrowing an example from Prakken and Sartor about a murder trial
# Using the Scheme for arguments from legal rules:
#   - The validity of a legal rule is assumed and supported with evidence only if questioned
#   - being excluded by some other (legal) rule is an exception
PROPOSITION:
  murder: the defendant murdered the victim
  malice : evidence for malice (intent of murder)
  killing: evidence for killing
  s187 valid: Section 187 - murder is unlawful killing, is valid
  s187 excluded: s187 is excluded
  self-defense: an act of self-defense
  s197 valid: Section 197 - An act of self-defense, is valid
  s197 excluded: s197 is excluded
  w1: Witness1 testified 'attack'
  w1-credible: Witness1 is credible
  w1-liar: Witness1 lied in court (contempt of court)
  w2: Witness2 saw testified 'time to run away'
  w2-credible: Witness2 is credible
  ev1: evidence 1 to support killing
  ev1 tampered: tampering of evidence 1
  ev2: evidence 2 to support malice
  ev2 tampered: tampering of evidence 2

ASSUMPTION: [ev1, ev2, s187 valid, s197 valid, w1, w2] # legal rules are assumed to be valid, unless questioned; exclusion of legal rules is not questioning legal rule but an exception to the rule - hence modeled as an exception

ARGUMENT:
# Added two new argument to imply that killing and malice is acceptable
  arg01 :
    premise: [ev1]
    exception: [ev1 tampered]
    conclusion: killing
    weight: 0.2

  arg02:
    premise: [ev2]
    exception: [ev2 tampered]
    conclusion: malice
    weight: 0.2

  arg1 :
    premise: [killing, malice, s187 valid] # these ordinary premises are assumed to be supported
    exception: [s187 excluded]
    conclusion: murder
    weight: 0.2

# The prosecution has met its burden of production
# Next, the defense put forward its self-defense argument:
  arg2:
    premise: [self-defense, s197 valid]
    exception: [s197 excluded]
    conclusion: s187 excluded # !!! this will cause the s187-valid to be removed from the audience's assumption
    weight: .5

  arg3 : # simplified scheme for arguments from testimony
# Since the testimony is made in court, the argument is accepted in court.
    premise: [w1]
    exception: [-w1-credible] # unless w1 is not credible
    conclusion: self-defense
    weight: 0.5

# The prosecution called a second witness to testify that the defendant had enough time to run away
  arg4:
    premise: [w2]
    exception: [-w2-credible]
    conclusion: -self-defense
    weight: 1


PROOFSTANDARD:
  murder: scintilla
  self-defense: preponderance # so that the maximum weight of the con outweights the argument for pro ! exactly, as expected, the argument is then valid

ISSUE: [murder]
