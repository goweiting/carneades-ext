# Toy example to illistrate:
# Here we have two arguments that suppor the issue; and one that does not
# CAES will naturally choose the argument with the largest weight to support
# the issue
# However, this argument (arg1) is defeated (since we can proof that the
# exception - `neg1`, is true).

# CAES automatically finds another argument to support the issue by searching
# for remaining arguments that have yet to added into the argumentation graph.

# Also showed that if it is a convergent argument style; CAES may be better off choosing one that doesnt require it to iterate through all the arguments. Here, we did not consider that as much, since we basically uses niave and greedy way of doing things!
