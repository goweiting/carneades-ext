# Toy example to illistrate:
# Here we have two arguments that suppor the issue; and one that does not
# CAES will naturally choose the argument with the largest weight to support
# the issue
# However, this argument (arg1) is defeated (since we can proof that the
# exception - `neg1`, is true).

# CAES automatically finds another argument to support the issue by searching
# for remaining arguments that have yet to added into the argumentation graph.
