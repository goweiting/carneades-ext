# Toy example to illistrate:
# convergent arguments are independent arguments that leads to the same
# conclusion.
# In CAES, accpetability of the issue is dependent on the arguments pro and con
# the issue at a 'timestep'.

# Also, since proofstandards uses the maximum and minimum weight of arguments to
# evaluate the issue, we always choose arguments with the maximum
# weight to start the dialogue. And if the maxmimum weight of the pro
# argument can alreadu lead to the burden of proof being shifted, then there
# is no need to consider other arguments.
# In the second example - 'convergentarg2.yml', we will see that if the best
# pro argument is defeated (hence not applicable) the CAES will consider the
# next best pro argument to be put forth

PROPOSITION:
  i: issue
  s1: support 1
  s2: support 2
  p1: premise1
  p2: premise2

ASSUMPTION: [p1, p2]

ARGUMENT:
# 'arg1' and 'arg2' both leads to 'i'. However, since both have the same
# weight, the sequence of considering them does not matter
  arg1:
    premise: [s1]
    exception: []
    conclusion: i
    weight: 0.5 # if weight is increased, this will be preferred; otherwise it doesnt really matter

  arg2:
    premise: [s2]
    exception: []
    conclusion: i
    weight: 0.5

  arg4:
    premise: [p1]
    exception: []
    conclusion: s1
    weight: 0.2

  arg5:
    premise: [p2]
    exception: []
    conclusion: s2
    weight: 0.2

ISSUE: [i]

PROOFSTANDARD: []

PARAMETER:
  alpha: 0.4
  beta: 0.3
  gamma: 0.3
